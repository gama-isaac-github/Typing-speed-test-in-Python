# Typing-speed-test-in-Python
A small game project that tests how fast the player types using randomly chosen words. Was written in python using the Tkinter library to generate the interface.
# How to play
Click "Novo teste" to generate new random text, then click "Iniciar teste" and enter the generated text as quickly as possible, after finishing, click "Finalizar teste" and see the results.
# Important
1. For now, the game interface is only available in Brazilian Portuguese;
2. If you want to change which words will be present in the generated text, simply edit the words.txt file, adding the words separated by space;
3. As the game accesses the words.txt file with each new test generated, all files must be in the same folder.
